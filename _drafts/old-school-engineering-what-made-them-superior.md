I started with codecademy.com, and have not even finished the course to this day, even as my second open source package ever is pushing past 250 stars on GitHub. Even though that's not a huge number, I see this is a relatively good success. I do need to update the code though.

Should I go back and finish the course? Probably. Will I go back and finish it? Definitely not.

The reason for this is that I've **moved on.** You can see this like breaking up amicably with an ex-girlfriend. Occasionally you do reminisce about her, corresponding to hacking together code in python, but really you've got a new partner who you devote most of your attention to.

Cue C++ from stage left. I promise this anecdote has some kind of link to the title.

When it comes to a lot of things in my life and with the world around me, I am essentially a fundamentalist (excluding anything spiritual). I believe that the most raw and unadulterated form of any concept or entity is the purest form of learning and experience. There is obviously a limit to this.
