## The Journey Begins Here
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

Is this not the most appropriate beginning to this blog?

Above you will see my vim setup. I will most likely go into more detail about that in the future. If it doesn't make sense, don't worry, it doesn't for me either. But it seems to work fairly well for me.

### The Future
I have no idea where this blog will go. I'm sure it will be interesting, but to what degree I do not know. Nor can I guarantee that it will be interesting to anyone other man myself.

But as a wise man (definitely myself) once told me:
